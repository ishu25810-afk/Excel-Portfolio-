# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis ☕

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of sales data for a coffee shop chain across 5 major US cities. Using a dataset of nearly **10,000 records**, I transformed raw transactional data into a high-level performance dashboard.

## 📊 Business Insights
* **Total Performance:** The business generated **$46,374** in total revenue with a healthy profit margin of **$16,231**.
* **Regional Leaders:** **Chicago** ($11.2K) and **Los Angeles** ($10.7K) are the primary revenue drivers.
* **Product Mix:** **Desserts** are the most popular item category by revenue, followed closely by **Sandwiches** and **Tea Beverages**.
* **Volume:** Successfully tracked the sale of **14,117 individual items** over a 3-year period (2021-2023).
* **Efficiency:** Analyzed daily transaction counts to identify "Peak Days" for better staff scheduling.

## ⚙️ How I Built This
1. **Data Cleaning:** Used Excel to handle date formatting and calculate the "Profit Margin" for every transaction.
2. **Pivot Tables:** Built summary tables to aggregate revenue by City, Month, and Category.
3. **Dashboard Design:** Created an interactive interface using **Slicers** (City and Year) to allow users to filter data instantly.
4. **Visualizations:** Used a mix of Bar Charts for regional comparisons and Line Graphs for 3-year revenue trends.
